# Research software engineer for a research-data infrastructure framework

The [Department of Clinical Medicine](https://clin.au.dk/) at [Faculty
of Health](https://health.au.dk/en/) at Aarhus University, in
collaboration with the [Steno Diabetes Center
Aarhus](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/) (SDCA), invites applications for
one position as "research software engineer" to work (in person or
remote) with a team on a software and data infrastructure project,
starting June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. The position for
'research software engineer' that are full-time and negotiable for up to
3 years.

At the Department of Clinical Medicine, you will be part of what is
probably the largest health science research department in Denmark. Our
clinical research covers all the medical specialties and takes place in
close collaboration with the university hospital and the regional
hospitals in the Central Denmark Region. At the department we are
approximately 425 academic employees and the same number of PhD students
cooperating across disciplines.

SDCA is a center that brings together researchers and clinicians in an
aim to better integrate work on multiple aspects of diabetes treatment,
research, and education.

This project aims to build an open and scalable data infrastructure
framework for working with, discovering, and managing data that follows
FAIR and open science principles. This is a *software* project that
focuses on working with data, but not on data itself. A description of
the project (called Seedcase) can be found at
<https://steno-aarhus.github.io/seedcase-project/>. The Seedcase project
will be contributing to the research of SDCA
(<https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research/>) as well as that of other Steno
centers and research initiatives throughout Denmark.

Since SDCA was started only a few years ago, its technical and social
infrastructure are still being actively developed. As a result, all SDCA
personnel, including this current position and the rest of the DIF team,
have a direct and impactful influence on how the culture and
infrastructure is built and developed. Aside from working on Seedcase,
other responsibilities for the research software engineer, as well as
the rest of the team, include contributing to building this organization
and culture.

## Your job responsibilities

As the research software engineer, you will be:

-   Building and developing RESTful APIs (or APIs in general) for
    Seedcase

-   Building and developing the frontend.

-   Reviewing contributed code and documentation text

-   Assisting with or developing tools for improving analysis and
    workflow pipelines related to using Seedcase (e.g. making Python/R
    packages and scripts)

*Note*, we anticipate that work on Seedcase project will not take up all
full-time work, so depending on the applicant's interest, we encourage
and support the research software engineer to collaborate on research
projects outside of the project time.

### Team-wide responsibilities

The **primary** responsibility for all members of the Seedcase team will
be building and developing the newly started DIF project. For a general
overview of timelines and tasks, see the Gantt chart in the project
roadmap
(<https://steno-aarhus.github.io/seedcase-project/community/contribute/roadmap.html>)
More specifically, tasks will include:

-   Refining, critiquing, and improving on the descriptions of the
    use-cases and the design and architecture of Seedcase

-   Finding and reviewing similar projects to identify what to use and
    what can be improved upon

-   Building, internally testing, and developing each component of
    Seedcase into Minimally Valuable Products for early external testing
    and refining

-   Writing public-facing, *beginner-friendly*, and accessible
    documentation on contributing to and using Seedcase

-   Creating and maintaining websites connected to Seedcase
    (e.g. through GitHub Pages)

All team members' *secondary* responsibilities (dependent on time
available outside of the DIF project):

-   Contributing to tasks and projects related to the general
    administration or building up of the general research environment
    (e.g. writing and/or updating onboarding documentation)

-   Assisting with building up general capacity and skills in
    reproducibility/transparency of research data analyses

-   Creating and running training sessions related to the Seedcase and
    to general computational analysis skills

*Note*, while the team as a whole will need to complete these tasks, any
individual member of the team *does not* need to do all these tasks and
instead will be assigned specific sections of the project.

You will report to the Unit Head Annelli Sandbæk and to the team leader
Luke Johnston.
