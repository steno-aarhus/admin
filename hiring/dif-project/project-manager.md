The Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA; <https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/>)
is hiring a team to work on a recently funded software and data project.
This project aims to build an open and scalable data infrastructure
framework (DIF) for working with, discovering, and managing data that
follows FAIR and open science principles. A full description of the DIF
project can be found at <https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dif-project/>.

SDCA is a center that brings together researchers and clinicians in an
aim to better integrate work on multiple aspects of diabetes treatment,
research, and education. The DIF project will be largely contributing to
the research of the center (<https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research/>) as
well as that of other research centers and initiatives throughout
Denmark.

Since SDCA was started only a few years ago, its technical and social
infrastructure are still being actively developed. As a result, all SDCA
personnel, including this current job along with the DIF team, have a
direct and impactful influence on how the culture and infrastructure is
built and developed. Aside from working on the DIF, other
responsibilities for the project manager, as well as the rest of the
