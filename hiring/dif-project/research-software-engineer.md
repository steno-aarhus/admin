The Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA; <https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/>)
is hiring a team to work on a recently funded software and data project.
This project aims to build an open and scalable data infrastructure
framework (DIF) for working with, discovering, and managing data that
follows FAIR and open science principles. A full description of the DIF
project can be found at <https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dif-project/>.

SDCA is a center that brings together researchers and clinicians in an
aim to better integrate work on multiple aspects of diabetes treatment,
research, and education. The DIF project will be largely contributing to
the research of the center (<https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research/>) as
well as that of other research centers and initiatives throughout
Denmark.

Since SDCA was started only a few years ago, its technical and social
infrastructure are still being actively developed. As a result, all SDCA
personnel, including this current job and the rest of the DIF team, have
a direct and impactful influence on how the culture and infrastructure
is built and developed. Aside from working on the DIF project, other
responsibilities for the research software engineer, as well as the rest
of the team, include contributing to this (explicit and inclusive)
culture, for instance by adding to our Common Docs
(<https://steno-aarhus.github.io/research/>).

## Responsibilities and tasks

The **primary** responsibility for all members of the DIF team will be
building and developing the newly started DIF project. More
specifically, tasks you will do include:

-   Refining, critiquing, and improving on the descriptions of the
    use-cases and the design and architecture of the DIF
-   Finding and reviewing similar projects to identify what to use and
    what can be improved upon
-   Building, internally testing, and developing each component of the
    DIF into Minimally Valuable Products for early external testing and
    refining
-   Writing public-facing, *beginner-friendly*, and accessible
    documentation on contributing to and using the DIF
-   Creating and maintaining websites connected to the DIF (e.g. through
    GitHub Pages)

All team members’ **secondary responsibilities**:

-   Contributing to tasks and projects related to the general
    administration or building up of SDCA (e.g. writing and/or updating
    onboarding documentation)
-   Assisting with building up general capacity and skills in
    reproducibility/transparency of research data analyses throughout
    SDCA
-   Creating and running training sessions related to the DIF and to
    general computational analysis skills

Responsibilities **specific to the research software engineer** include:

-   Building and developing RESTful APIs (or APIs in general) for the
    DIF
-   Reviewing contributed code and documentation text
-   Assisting with or developing tools for improving analysis and
    workflow pipelines (e.g. making Python/R packages and scripts)

*Note*, since we anticipate that work on the DIF project will not take
up all full-time work, depending on the applicant’s interest, we
encourage and support the research software engineer to pursue their own
or collaborate on research outside of the project time. There are many
opportunities for research, networking, and collaboration within SDCA
and across Denmark.
