The Department of Clinical Medicine (<https://clin.au.dk/>) at Aarhus
University in collaboration with the Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA;
<https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/>) invites applications for research
software engineer positions to work on a team on a recently funded
software and data project. This project aims to build an open and
scalable data infrastructure framework (DIF) for working with,
discovering, and managing data that follows FAIR and open science
principles. This is largely a *software* project that focuses on working
with data, but not on data itself. A description of the DIF project can
be found at <https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dif-project/>.

SDCA is a center that brings together researchers and clinicians in an
aim to better integrate work on multiple aspects of diabetes treatment,
research, and education. The Department of Clinical Medicine, one of the
largest health research department in Denmark, covers all the medical
specialties and has close collaboration with the Region’s hospitals. You
can read more about the department here and about the faculty here. The
DIF project will be largely contributing to the research of the center
(<https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research/>) as well as that of other Steno
centers and research initiatives throughout Denmark.

Since SDCA was started only a few years ago, its technical and social
infrastructure are still being actively developed. As a result, all SDCA
personnel, including this current position and the rest of the DIF team,
have a direct and impactful influence on how the culture and
infrastructure is built and developed. Aside from working on the DIF
project, other responsibilities for the research software engineer, as
well as the rest of the team, include contributing to this (explicit and
inclusive) culture, for instance by adding to our Common Docs
(<https://steno-aarhus.github.io/research/>).

## Expected start date and duration of employment

This position is expected to start TBD or as soon as possible after this
date and is for 5 years and 2 years.

## Job description, responsibilities, and tasks

### Team-wide responsibilities

The **primary** responsibility for all members of the DIF team will be
building and developing the newly started DIF project. For a general
overview of timelines and tasks, see the Gantt chart in the project
description
(<https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dif-project/#deliverables-and-milestones>)
More specifically, tasks will include:

-   Refining, critiquing, and improving on the descriptions of the
    use-cases and the design and architecture of the DIF
-   Finding and reviewing similar projects to identify what to use and
    what can be improved upon
-   Building, internally testing, and developing each component of the
    DIF into Minimally Valuable Products for early external testing and
    refining
-   Writing public-facing, *beginner-friendly*, and accessible
    documentation on contributing to and using the DIF
-   Creating and maintaining websites connected to the DIF (e.g. through
    GitHub Pages)

All team members’ *secondary* responsibilities (dependent on time
available outside of the DIF project):

-   Contributing to tasks and projects related to the general
    administration or building up of the general research environment
    (e.g. writing and/or updating onboarding documentation)
-   Assisting with building up general capacity and skills in
    reproducibility/transparency of research data analyses
-   Creating and running training sessions related to the DIF and to
    general computational analysis skills

*Note*, while the team as a whole will need to complete these tasks, any
individual member of the team *does not* need to do all these tasks and
instead will be assigned specific sections of the project.

### Research software engineer responsibilities

As the research software engineer, you will be:

-   Building and developing RESTful APIs (or APIs in general) for the
    DIF
-   Reviewing contributed code and documentation text
-   Assisting with or developing tools for improving analysis and
    workflow pipelines related to using the DIF (e.g. making Python/R
    packages and scripts)

*Note*, we anticipate that work on the DIF project will not take up all
full-time work, so depending on the applicant’s interest, we encourage
and support the research software engineer to pursue their own or
collaborate on research projects outside of the project time. There are
many opportunities for research, networking, and collaboration within
SDCA and across Denmark.

## Your profile: Qualifications and experiences

We expect, at a minimum, that *all team members*:

-   Have worked on, started, or contributed to open source projects on
    open sharing and collaborative platforms (e.g. Open Science
    Framework, GitHub, GitLab)
-   Have used Git or other version control software on a fairly regular
    basis for projects
-   Are proficient in communicating (written and oral) in English
-   Are motivated, interested, and comfortable with working on projects
    that have recently started and that require contributing to a
    diversity of tasks typical of the early stages of any initiative

And we prefer, but don’t require, that you:

-   Have knowledge of and familiarity with *general* software
    development practices
-   Are interested in or motivated to be involved in aspects of building
    up and developing the culture and infrastructure of a newer
    organization
-   Have Knowledge of and experience in implementing and adhering to
    FAIR principles

As the *research software engineer*, we expect you to:

-   Have demonstrated knowledge of and experience in using either Python
    or R for general programming tasks (need to be open to learning
    both)
-   Have developed software packages in Python or R that abides by
    community-accepted standard practices (e.g. PIP or CRAN)

We prefer, but don’t require, that you as the *research software
engineer*:

-   Have experience in or familiar with using HTML, CSS, and other web
    technologies.
-   Are familiar with general User Interface (UI) and/or User Experience
    (UX) design principles
-   Have experience in or familiar with interacting with and/or
    developing APIs
-   Are familiar with general data engineering practices
-   Have some experience or familiarity with the research environment
    and its specific set of needs

## Who we are/will be

We will be building up the core team so that in the end we will be two
full-time research software engineers (one 5 year and one 2 year
positions), a data manager, a database administrator, a team leader, as
well as affiliate researchers and the primary investigator. We think
we’re a fun and relaxed group, and we have a great working environment
and colleagues :)
<!-- External collaborators include 2-3 data managers and coordinators as well as -->
<!-- consultant software engineers. -->

## What we offer

-   The position can (depending on where the applicant lives) be largely
    remote / work from home
    -   If you live or move to Aarhus for the position, we’d prefer that
        you come into the office twice a week
    -   If you live outside of Denmark, we expect (and will cover) for
        you to participate in bigger in person meetings/events (e.g. our
        annual research retreat)
-   The working hours are very flexible.
-   Any necessary hardware or software will be provided or covered for.
