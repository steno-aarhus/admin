The Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA; <https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/>)
is hiring a team to work on a recently funded software and data project.
This project aims to build an open and scalable data infrastructure
framework (DIF) for working with, discovering, and managing data that
follows FAIR and open science principles. This is largely a *software*
project that focuses on working with data, but not on data itself. A
description of the DIF project can be found at
<https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dif-project/>.

The core DIF team will be composed of two full-time research software
engineers, a data manager, a database administrator, two project
managers/coordinators, as well as the primary investigator. External and
occasional collaborators include 2-3 data managers and coordinators as
well as consultant software engineers.

Because the project is just starting up, the DIF team will be completing

SDCA is a center that brings together researchers and clinicians in an
aim to better integrate work on multiple aspects of diabetes treatment,
research, and education. The DIF project will be largely contributing to
the research of the center (<https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research/>) as
well as that of other research centers and initiatives throughout
Denmark.

Since SDCA was started only a few years ago, its technical and social
infrastructure are still being actively developed. As a result, all SDCA
personnel, including this current position and the rest of the DIF team,
have a direct and impactful influence on how the culture and
infrastructure is built and developed. Aside from working on the DIF
project, other responsibilities for the data manager, as well as the
rest of the team, include contributing to this (explicit and inclusive)
culture, for instance by adding to our Common Docs
(<https://steno-aarhus.github.io/research/>).
