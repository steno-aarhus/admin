The Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA; https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/) is hiring
a team to work on a recently funded software and data project. This project
aims to build an open and scalable infrastructure Framework for working with,
discovering, and managing data that follows FAIR and open science principles.
A full description of the Framework project can be found at 
https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dif-project/.

SDCA is a center that brings together researchers and clinicians in an aim to
better integrate work on multiple aspects of diabetes treatment, research, and
education. The Framework project will be largely contributing to the research of
the center (https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/research/) as well as that of other
